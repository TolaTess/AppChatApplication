# AppChat
AppChat is a spin the wheel game that gives users with challenges to help elevate boredom. This app was built using Java Programming language, Firebase authentication, realtime database, file storage, Picasso image library, Butterknife UI binding library and Volley for API calls. The MVP architecture model was used to keep the code simple, easy to understand and maintain.
